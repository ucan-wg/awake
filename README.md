# 0. Abstract

Authorization With Authenticated Key Exchange (AWAKE) is an [AKE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticated_Key_Exchange) built on top of the [UCAN auth token](https://github.com/ucan-wg/spec) specification. AWAKE is similar to other mutual authentication schemes, such as self-signed [mTLS](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8705), but with a focus on authorization proofs. AWAKE leverages the capability chain to prove access to some resource, validating that the requestor is communicating with a party capable of performing certain actions. 

## Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119).
